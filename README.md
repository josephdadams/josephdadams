🎛️ Technical Director • 💻 Software Developer • 🎥 Tech & Broadcast Enthusiast

Over the past 20+ years, I’ve built a career bridging **live production** and **custom software**, helping organizations run smoother, smarter, and more connected. I'm currently Technical Director for a megachurch in the Southeast US, and I build open-source tools and consulting solutions on the side.

## 💡 What I Do

- 🎚️ **Broadcast + AVL Systems** – Building resilient systems for broadcast, event, live video and worship environments
- 🧩 **Custom Software** – Tools for control, automation, and integrations (Node.js, Electron, Companion modules)  
- 🔗 **Systems Consulting** – Helping teams solve complex tech problems through simple, scalable solutions

## 🧠 Open‑Source Focus

I'm a core contributor to **B[itfocus Companion](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion)**, with over 100 modules authored or maintained.

I also build standalone tools and integrations that connect systems across the broadcast, worship, and tech spaces.
